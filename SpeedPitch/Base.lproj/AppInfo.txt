SpeedPitch is a simple augmented sonic reality experiment that alters music playback speed based on your actual GPS ground speed. The faster you go, the higher the pitch and sudden stops lead to dragging audio samples. Natural motion leads to unnatural sound.

Usage:
1. Select files from the Music app or Files browser using the buttons in the main screen, upper right
2. Start playback via pressing play or tapping a song in the playlist screen
3. Ride you bike or take a walk and see what happens...

You can adjust the speed limit for the pitch processing to set the speed songs are played back at a normal rate: menu button upper right -> Speed.

This project has been developed as part of the Nix Wie Raus! Fahrrad Kunst Sommer exhibition, Karlsruhe Germany 2021.
